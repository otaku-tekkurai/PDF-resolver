# PDF-Resolver

## About The Project

The PDF Resolver feature enables advanced interaction and manipulation of PDF documents. With PDF Resolver, users can highlight selected text and categorize it with labels, making it easier to annotate and organize information. Additionally, this feature supports customization, allowing users to define and integrate tailored actions for a more flexible, personalized PDF processing experience.


### **Need for the Project**

With the growing number of use cases for manipulations on PDF within ZoopSign, there is a need for a **interactive** feature .

This feature can be used because of pdfjs-dist library that enables us to render a canvas of a pdf, where we perform manipulations.
